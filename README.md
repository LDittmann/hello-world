# hello-world
It would be nice if the world would say "hello - right back atcha", just once
I mean, I suppose it is ironic that I am saying "hello, world!" through
a computer, when it would be much faster to just go outside, 
and say hello directly, myself.
Perhaps the world cannot hear me through this wretched machine...
Maybe I need to say it louder... 
"HELLO WORLD!!!"
